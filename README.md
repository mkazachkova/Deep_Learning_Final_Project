Deep Learning 2018 Final project building off of repository described below: 

PyTorch implementation of [Image-to-Image Translation Using Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004v1.pdf).

Based on [pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) by Isola et al.

The examples from the paper:

## Prerequisites

+ Linux
+ Python with numpy
+ NVIDIA GPU + CUDA 8.0 + CuDNNv5.1
+ pytorch
+ torchvision

## Acknowledgments

This code is a concise implementation of [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix). Much easier to understand.

Highly recommend the more completed and organized code [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) by original author junyanz.
